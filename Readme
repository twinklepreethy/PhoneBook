CREATE DATABASE phonebook;

CREATE TABLE Contacts(
    FirstName varchar(50),
    LastName varchar(50),
    PhoneNumber varchar(50)
);

--Some dummy data
INSERT INTO Contacts (FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber) VALUES ('JOHN', 'SMITH', '123456789')
INSERT INTO Contacts (FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber) VALUES ('ADAM', 'TOWLE', '987654321')
INSERT INTO Contacts (FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber) VALUES ('MARY', 'POPPINS', '876234409')

As my company laptop has some restrictions for connecting to localhost, I wasn't able to run the application with actual db connection. 
But I have done checks with dummy data and unit testing, and I've also added sql script for db and table creation. Please use the above script in your db.
It will run.
As I started with HTML, I've done all the front end work with HTML. I had to refresh myself with javascript as it has been around 2 years since I used it.

About the application:
-----------------------------------------------
To run the application, please enter db connection string in appsettings.json
I've used SOLID principles as much as possible and also repository pattern.
Have used TDD approach.
Used Moq and AutoFixture for mocking and auto initialisations.
Used Dapper for SQL Connection.
Since you asked notes about running the application, just mentioning that application is quite simple and once you run it, it'll be straightforward.
I've supplied a simple script to connect to the DB as it meets the requirement for this asessment,I would have used fluent migrator and docker to run the scripts in db for
a production application.
Haven't done validation since I wanted to finish the asessment on the same evening.
